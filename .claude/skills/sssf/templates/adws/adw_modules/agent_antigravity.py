"""Antigravity CLI adapter — the HarnessAdapter behind coding_agent: antigravity.

Runs `agy -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json` and tails its NDJSON stdout
line by line, same shape as agent_pi.run(): raw lines land in raw_output_path
verbatim, and normalized tool_call records are the only thing forwarded to the
caller via on_event.

Event schema is Antigravity CLI 1.1.26's headless stream, documented at
antigravity.google/docs/cli/headless and confirmed against the binary: one
`init` event, any number of `step_update` events, and exactly one `result`
event, each line an object whose `event` field names its type and whose payload
hangs off a key of the same name. A `step_update` carries `step_type`
(`user_input`, `agent_response`, `tool`, `checkpoint`), `state` (`ACTIVE` while
running, `DONE` when finished), and on tool steps a `tool_info` of
`{name, parameters, output, error}`. Like the Codex adapter this targets one CLI
version and is not defensive against other schemas beyond ignoring unrecognized
events.

Effort: `agy` sells effort as part of the model slug — `gemini-3.8-flash-low`,
`-medium` and `-high` are three catalog entries, not one model with a knob — and
passing `--effort` alongside such a slug is a hard CLI error rather than a
preference it reconciles. So `--effort` is sent only for a tier-less slug, and
`validate()` rejects a `thinking` that contradicts the slug's own tier instead
of letting the slug quietly win and the roster misreport what ran. See
`_model_effort`.

Flag order is deliberate and was verified, not assumed: `agy`'s help output is
the Go `flag` package's, which stops parsing at the first positional argument.
Because `--print`/`-p` takes the prompt as its VALUE, the flags that follow it
are still parsed — a real run confirms `--output-format stream-json` and
`--model` both take effect when they trail the prompt (`init.model` echoes the
requested model, `init.permission_mode` echoes `always-proceed`). Had `-p` been
a boolean, every flag after the prompt would have been silently dropped.

Usage is the richest of any adapter here: `result.usage` reports real token
counts, so tokens reconcile with what the CLI itself prints. It reports no
dollars — Antigravity bills AI credits — so `usage.total_cost` stays 0 rather
than carry a number in the wrong unit.

Tools: `tools:` cannot be honored, and nothing is invented to pretend
otherwise. Antigravity's headless mode has no tool-allowlist flag; scoping is
done with `permissions.allow` rules in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`,
which SSSF does not own and must not rewrite. Silently ignoring `tools` would
let the agent use every tool regardless of what the config asked for, so
`validate()` rejects any effective list — exactly as the Codex adapter does.

Every turn runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, which is a deliberate
choice, not a shortcut. Headless mode SOFT-DENIES a tool it cannot get approval
for: the run continues, exits 0, and only prints a notice to stderr. Shell
commands default to Ask, so without the flag a builder would report success on
a phase whose commands were quietly refused — a green trace over work that
never happened, which is the one failure this system is built to make
impossible. Repo write scope stays where it always is, enforced after the call
by permissions.enforce() against `writes` and `protected_files`. An operator
who wants narrower grants than "all tools, then check the diff" writes
`permissions.allow` rules in the CLI's own settings and they still apply,
because they are consulted before this flag is.

`read_only` is not used to pick a native sandbox. `--sandbox` here means
terminal sandbox restrictions, not Codex's `--sandbox read-only` filesystem
mode, and equating the two would claim a guarantee the flag does not give.

Effort: `--effort` accepts `low | medium | high` only, so `validate()` rejects
the rest of Pi's ladder (`off`, `minimal`, `xhigh`, `max`) at config time
instead of letting the CLI reject it mid-run.

Model: not pre-validated. `agy models` prints a two-column human table whose
exact shape this adapter has not observed, and a parser that misreads it would
fail a valid roster at validate() time. Headless mode already fails loudly on
an unknown `--model` (non-zero exit, `status: ERROR`) rather than silently
falling back, so the CLI is the better judge. `context_window` is therefore
reported as 0 — unknown — rather than guessed.

`--print-timeout` is raised well above the CLI's 5-minute default: a builder
phase implementing a plan routinely runs longer, and the default would kill it
mid-edit.

Session continuation: `--conversation <id>` resumes a specific conversation by
the `conversation_id` a previous run reported. agents.py always offers a
session_id (its own placeholder when there is no prior mapped session for this
coding_agent + model), so that value is treated as resumable only when it
parses as a UUID, exactly like the Claude Code and Codex adapters. `--continue`
is deliberately unused: it resumes "the most recent conversation" in the
directory, which is whichever agent happened to run last, not this one.

Antigravity has no system-prompt flag, so the system prompt is folded into the
prompt text — but only on a FRESH turn. A resumed turn already carries it as the
first thing in that conversation's history, and agents.py only resumes a
conversation created by this same agent, so re-sending it would pay for the
whole system prompt again on every JSON retry and gate correction.

Auth is whatever `agy` is already logged in as on this machine — the adapter
never reads or stores a credential. An unauthenticated non-interactive run
exits with `authentication required` instead of hanging.
