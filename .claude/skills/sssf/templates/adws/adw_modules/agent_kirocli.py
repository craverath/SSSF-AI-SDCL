"""Kiro CLI adapter — the HarnessAdapter behind coding_agent: kiro_cli.

Runs `kiro-cli chat --agent-engine v3 --output-format stream-json` and tails
its JSONL stdout line by line, same shape as agent_pi.run(): raw lines land in
raw_output_path verbatim, and normalized tool_call records are the only thing
forwarded to the caller via on_event.

Event schema is Kiro CLI 2.21.0's `--output-format stream-json` stream, which
the CLI documents as "the run's ACP events as JSON Lines on stdout". Every
line is `{"type": ..., "data": {...}}` with four types this adapter reads:
`runStarted`, `sessionUpdate` (an ACP `session/update` notification, whose
`update.sessionUpdate` names the real event), `runFinished` (carries the
authoritative `finalText`), and `runError`. Anything else is skipped. Like the
Codex adapter, this targets one CLI version and is not defensive against other
schemas beyond ignoring unrecognized events.

WHY `--agent-engine v3` IS PINNED, and not left to the CLI's own default:
`--output-format stream-json` is rejected outright on the v1 engine, and on
v2 the two flags SSSF cares about most are accepted and then silently dropped —
`--model no-such-model` only logs `[warn] failed to set model ...: Method not
found` and runs the settings default anyway (exit 0), and `--effort` never
takes: low, high and max all report the value from `chat.modelDefaults`. An
adapter on v2 would make the roster a lie, since sssf.config.yaml's whole
premise is that config picks the model. On v3 an unknown model fails loudly
(`InvalidModelError`, exit 1), which is the behavior validate() and run() are
written against.

Tools: `tools:` cannot be honored here, and nothing is invented to pretend
otherwise. v3's `--trust-tools` takes KAS's own tool ids, not Pi's vocabulary,
and a name it does not recognize does not fall back to "allowed" — it DENIES.
Measured on 2.21.0: `--trust-tools=shell` makes the agent's shell call come
back `The user rejected this tool call`, while `--trust-tools=run_command`
runs it. A wrong mapping would therefore silently disarm the agent rather
than merely mis-describe it, so `validate()` rejects any effective `tools`
list instead of guessing at that table.

Consequently every turn runs with `--trust-all-tools`, which is a deliberate
choice, not a shortcut: non-interactive mode has nobody to answer a trust
prompt, an untrusted call comes back rejected, and the run still exits 0 — so
without it an agent reports success on a phase in which its tools were quietly
refused. Repo write scope stays where it always is, enforced after the call by
permissions.enforce() against `writes` and `protected_files`. `read_only` is
not used here: Kiro CLI has no read-only sandbox flag, and a read-only agent
still has to write its own report into context_handoff/.

Effort: `--effort` is passed and pre-validated against the range the CLI's own
help documents (low | medium | high | xhigh | max), because an unsupported
value is not rejected by the CLI — `--effort off` is accepted and silently
ignored. Whether v3 honors the flag at all could not be verified from the
stream: unlike v2's `metadata` event, v3 reports no effort back. Two further
limits are the model's, not the flag's: some models expose no effort at all,
and others accept a narrower ladder (claude-sonnet-4.6 has no `xhigh`).

Usage: Kiro CLI reports neither billed tokens nor dollars. It bills credits,
per turn and explicitly unit-labelled
(`_meta.kiro.promptTurnSummaries[] = {"unit": "credit", "usage": 0.0275}`), so
`usage.total_tokens` and `usage.total_cost` stay 0 rather than carry a number
in the wrong unit — a credit is not a dollar, and the trace's cost column must
not say it is. The credits figure stays verbatim in `raw_output.jsonl`; there
is no field for it on `UsageBreakdown`, and inventing one whose other
producers report dollars would be the same lie.

Context occupancy IS real and exact: `_meta.kiro.breakdown` reports absolute
token counts per component (`contextFiles`, `kiroResponses`, `sessionFiles`,
`tools`, `yourPrompts`), which are summed into `context_tokens`. The window
ceiling comes from the model's `context_window_tokens` in `kiro-cli chat
--list-models --format json`. The sibling `usagePercentage` is deliberately
NOT used to derive occupancy — see `_context_tokens`.

Session continuation: Kiro assigns its own id, and v3's is `sess_<uuid>`
rather than a bare UUID, so the resumable test accepts both — agents.py always
offers a session_id (its own placeholder when there is no prior mapped session
for this coding_agent + model), and anything that is not a Kiro-shaped id means
"start fresh". `--resume-id <id>` continues an existing context window (verified:
a codeword set in one turn is recalled in the next).

Kiro CLI has no system-prompt flag, so the system prompt is folded into the
prompt text — but only on a FRESH turn. A resumed turn already carries it as
the first thing in that session's history, and agents.py only resumes a
session created by this same agent, so re-sending it would pay for the whole
system prompt again on every JSON retry and gate correction.

Auth is whatever `kiro-cli` is already logged in as on this machine — the
adapter never reads or stores a credential.
